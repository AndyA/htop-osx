This Mac OS X fork is outdated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

htop 1.x has been released for Linux, but this Mac fork is based
on htop 0.8.x from 2009. Check the original htop webpage for Mac
OS X support.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is htop, an interactive process viewer.
It requires ncurses. It is tested with Linux 2.6,
but is also reported to work (and was originally developed)
with the 2.4 series.

Note that, while, htop is Linux specific -- it is based
on the Linux /proc filesystem -- it is also reported to work
with FreeBSD systems featuring a Linux-compatible /proc.

This software has evolved considerably during the last months,
and is reasonably complete, but there is still room for
improvement. Read the TODO file to see what's known to be missing.

Comparison between 'htop' and 'top'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * In 'htop' you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally
   to see all processes and full command lines.
 * In 'top' you are subject to a delay for each unassigned
   key you press (especially annoying when multi-key escape
   sequences are triggered by accident).
 * 'htop' starts faster ('top' seems to collect data for a while
   before displaying anything).
 * In 'htop' you don't need to type the process number to
   kill a process, in 'top' you do.
 * In 'htop' you don't need to type the process number or
   the priority value to renice a process, in 'top' you do.
 * In 'htop' you can kill multiple processes at once.
 * 'top' is older, hence, more tested.

Compilation instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.
See the INSTALL file for detailed instructions, but you are
probably used to the common "configure/make/make install" routine.

See the manual page (man htop) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'
inside htop) for a list of supported key commands.

if not all keys work check your curses configuration.
